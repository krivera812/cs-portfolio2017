    <p class="dogs"> Dogs are one of my favorite animals for many reasons. Dogs are cute and are fun to play with. <br>Though they are hard work as puppies, they can overcome problems like depression and anxiety. Another thing is that they serve purpose for the disabled. <br> They also serve the purpose to help with excerise. Though it may seem like a task, dogs require walking, but that could be helpful for not only the dog but the human as well. They also aid in the gaining of responsibility.

    <p class="music"> For me, music is a getaway. <br>Everyone has their own prefrences which the most amazing part of music. Not only do we get to listen to music, we can play it too. In fact, I can play about 5 instruments, my favorite being the piano. When you learn how to play an instrument, you learn new skill sets. I've also learned that on the pathway of learning about music, you tend to meet new potential friends or just simply gain respect for others.</p>
